\section{RESULTS}\label{sec:4experiment}
In this section, we detail the evaluation results for our system.

\subsection{Evaluation of Subcomponents}
We focus on the detection accuracy about five events, that are body posture, the body rollover, the hand position, the micro body movements and the acoustic events.

\subsubsection{Sleep Posture Classification Performance}
\label{subsub:bodyposture}

We first test the overall classification performance of different body postures. The ground truth of body postures is recorded by the cameras. To avoid biases in the evaluation, and to assess the generalization performance of our approach, we consider a cross-validation scheme where all data from a single participant is used for training and data from the remaining $14$ participants is used for testing. The motivation for using data from a single user as training data is to highlight the capability of {\systemname} to accurately characterize body posture with very little training data, while at the same time being able to generalize across users. The final performance is then calculated as the averaged accuracy across the 15 folds; as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:posture_zhu} and Table \ref{tab:posture}. We can observe that the posture detection accuracy is consistently high across all users, and does not show major variations across users. This good performance benefits from the distinct characteristics of arm position under different sleeping postures. Compared to results reported for SleepMonitor~\cite{sleepmonitor}, {\systemname} consistently improves performance which is mainly due to the template-based classifier that we use to verify classifications of the prone and supine states. In particular, {\systemname} achieves around $5$ percentage units higher performance on the prone state than SleepMonitor and overall has a lower false positive rate. In addition, {\systemname} considers more hand positions than SleepMonitor in 4 sleeping postures. In terms of errors, due to angular characteristics of acceleration being similar between the supine posture with the hand putting on the head and the left-lateral posture, a small amount of the supine postures are classified as left lateral. From the results, we can also observe that the total amount of the prone posture is smaller than the number of other postures, which suggests that people are not accustomed to sleeping in this position because it is neither healthy nor comfortable.

\subsubsection{Performance of Body Rollover Counting}
To verify the efficiency of body rollover detection algorithm, we compare each user's body rollover events detected by {\systemname} against the data labeled by watching the video. The performance is shown in Table \ref{tab:rollver}. We can see that User 3, User 4 and User 13 have an unusually high number of rollovers. For User 3 and User 4, they have difficulty in falling asleep due to the sleep disorder. User 13 needs to rollover frequently because of his loudly snoring. As we demonstrate in Sec.~\ref{sec:user_survey}, these participants also suffered from poor sleep quality and hence indicate how the information extracted by {\systemname} can support the detection of sleep problems. For all the 15 users, the detection accuracies are all very high, and the lowest one is still 87\%. Thus {\systemname} can accurately distinguish the large hand movement from the body rollover in bed. Moreover, detecting errors in body rollover events will not have a significant impact on our end result, because the division of sleep stages is a comprehensive consideration of all the detected features in each stage, such as micro body movement and acoustic events.

        \bottomrule
 \end{tabular}
\end{table}

\subsubsection{Performance of Hand Position Recognition}
To test the recognition performance of different hand positions, we consider the same cross-validation scheme used for body posture detection, i.e., one user's data is used for training the classifier and the remaining 14 users' data as test data. The classifier for detecting the hand movement trajectory is combined with the detection of periodic signals caused by respiration, then the hand position on the chest (or abdomen or head) can be identified. In our dataset, 14\%, 36\% and 22\% of the time the hand in the supine posture during sleep were placed on the head, abdomen, and chest respectively. Fig.~\ref{fig:hand_zhu} illustrates the accuracy of hand position across 15 users. As we can see that with just one set of training data, the accuracies for different users are all higher than 87\%. Therefore, our system can achieve a good identification accuracy for different hand positions. Moreover, we find that at least four out of fifteen participants tend to put their hands on their heads; one participate unconsciously puts his hand on his chest which makes him have nightmares. Those are all bad habits disrupting a good sleep. {\systemname} can report such key findings to improve the users' sleep qualities.


\subsubsection{Performance of Micro Body Movement Detection}

To assess the detection accuracy of micro body movements, we manually label the ground truth recorded by the camera during sleep, including hand moving, arm raising, and body trembling. We also use the accelerometer embedded in the smartphone which placed on the bed to record the occurrence of micro body movements, so as to avoid missing some movements such as trembling concealed by the duvet. For the acceleration data collected by smartphone, we first smooth the acceleration along the three axes, calculate Root Sum Square (RSS) to merge them and obtain the first-order derivative of the merged acceleration. And then we use the threshold detection method to mark the occurrence of motion. Since body trembling is the easiest to be covered, we only focus on such events. So we use a smartphone to detect the occurrence of events and the classification of the event is not performed. Table~\ref{tab:micro_move} list the total number of three micro body movements for each user over the testing period of 14 days, and Fig.~\ref{fig:micro_movement_zhu} reports the accuracy of {\systemname} for detecting these micro body movements. It shows that the accuracies for all users are very close, that is, there will be no major changes between users. And from Fig. \ref{fig:micro_combine}, we find that even though the worst classification result belongs to the hand movement, the average precision value and recall value still exceed 75\%. The averaged accuracies of arm raising and body trembling are 93\% and 84\%, respectively. Because the training data volume for the hand movement and body trembling is small, so the performance can be improved by setting each user a threshold by collecting a longer term's sleeping data. In addition, the purpose of micro body movement detection is to detect different sleep stages, and the hand movement usually appears in all sleep stages, thus the poor accuracy of hand moving does not have a significant impact on the final result.

 \subsubsection{Performance of Acoustic Events Detection}

To study the detection accuracies of different acoustic events, we compare the ground truth recorded by the camera with the detected results by our system. Table~\ref{tab:sound} shows the results across 15 participants. We can see that the precision for the cough event is 88.9\%, which is slightly lower than for the other three event types. The reason is that different user's cough patterns are different, the pre-defined parameters in the detection model do not include all possible patterns. For example, some people have a fast and continuous pattern of coughing, while others have a slower intermittent pattern. In fact, we train these parameters, namely the "interval", "duration" and "frequency" of acoustic events, with only 120 sets of nighttime sound data. Those data come from 40 (21 males and 19 females) volunteers of different ages (from 15 to 60 years old) who are prone to snoring, coughing, or somniloquy at night. To further improve the detection accuracy, we can train particular parameters for different users. And we can further expand the training data to include more possible patterns, and can also make reasonable estimates of the possible patterns to refine the range of parameters and thus increase the accuracy.

\subsection{Overall Performance \label{sec:overall_per}}

\subsubsection{Performance of Sleep Stage Detection}

In order to prove that the detected events not only reflect the user's sleep habits, but also effectively identify the sleep stages to assess the sleep quality, we regard the reported results from Fitbit Charge2 as the ground truth. To perform the evaluation, we randomly choose $50$ sets of sleep data from the data so that at least $3$ sets per participant are chosen for evaluation. For detecting changes in sleep stage, {\systemname} uses event-driven detection. When there is no sleep event detected in 15 minutes, we evaluate the sleep stage. When an event occurs, we immediately evaluate the sleep stage and use this time as the starting point for the next 15 minutes. The averaged precision value and recall value are shown in Table~\ref{tab:sleep stage}. It indicates that though {\systemname} may make misjudgment between the light sleep and REM, overall the performance is satisfying and comparable to current consumer-grade monitors. Moreover, as we later demonstrate, the main benefits of {\systemname} result from its capability to estimate a wide range of sleep events and how they relate to sleep quality, not from its performance in sleep stage detection where medical PSG measurements are required for accurate assessment of sleep stages.

\subsubsection{Effect of Respiratory Amplitude on Sleep Stage Detection}

When we detect different sleep stages, we also consider the respiratory amplitude when the hand's position is in the abdomen or chest. To assess the effectiveness of respiratory amplitude estimation, we evaluate the performance of the sleep stage detection in two cases, that is with and without taking the respiration amplitude into account. The performance of sleep stage detection is shown in Table~\ref{tab:respiratory}. For three different sleep stages, both the precision and recall values are improved with the help of respiratory amplitude estimation. In fact, the respiratory frequency can also be used as a feature to help us to detect sleep stages. But in fact their essence the same. The difference in respiratory amplitude will also affect the difference in respiratory frequency, because when the respiratory amplitude is large, the time taken for one breath will be long, and the frequency of breathing will be slower. In {\systemname}, we choose the respiratory amplitude because the feature is very intuitive.

\subsubsection{Performance Comparison}

We compare {\systemname} with two state-of-the-art sleep monitoring applications. The first is a sleep detection app called ``Sleep As Android", and the second one is a smartphone-based system named Sleep Hunter~\cite{gu2016sleep}. The former app is designed to estimate sleep time and assess sleep by recording the state of motions and the number of body exercises. The latter focuses on estimating sleep stages and evaluate the sleep quality using the tracked sleep-related events. Considering that Sleep As Android can only detect light sleep stage and deep sleep stage, we only compare the performance of these two stages. Table \ref{tab:comparison} shows the detection results. As we can see, {\systemname} significantly outperforms Sleep As Android and deliver better performance than Sleep Hunter. The performance advantage of {\systemname} comes from the incorporation of rich and complicated sleep events.

We also implement the algorithms employed by Sleep Hunter and apply them to the data collected using our smartwatch. This experiment allows us to check if the better performance of {\systemname} is due to the use of a smartwatch instead of a mobile phone.

For body movement detection, applying the algorithms employed by Sleep Hunter to our smartwatch data gives a comparable accuracy of around 96\% when the system only identify between drastic and small body movements. However, Sleep Hunter doesn't work when we need to detect finer-grained body movements.  {\systemname} outperforms Sleep Hunter by delivering an accuracy of drastic body movements around 90\% (see Table~\ref{tab:rollver}) and an accuracy of finer-grained body movements more than 78\% (see Fig.~\ref{fig:micro_combine}). For acoustic event detections, we apply the Sleep Hunter algorithms to detect snore, cough and somniloquy. The results in Table \ref{tab:compare_sound1} suggest that {\systemname} gives better performance over Sleep Hunter in detecting these acoustic events. Finally, we apply the sleep stage detection model used by Sleep Hunter to combine sleep-related events to identify sleep stages. The results are shown in Table \ref{tab:compare_stage1}. Again,  {\systemname} outperforms the Sleep Hunter model with a higher accuracy and recall.


This experiment confirms that the algorithms used by Sleep Hunter for sleep event and stage detection are not tuned for the smartwatch. Compared to Sleep Hunter, {\systemname} can detect sleep events and stages with a higher accuracy using a set of carefully designed methods target to target smartwatch.


\subsubsection{User Survey}\label{sec:user_survey}

To understand and verify how the additional information captured by {\systemname} supports users, at the end of the experiments the participants are administrated a survey to the participants asking about their experiences with {\systemname} and their personal sleeping patterns. We combine these results with the subjective sleep quality estimates obtained through the PSQI questionnaires administered during the study. We considered two groups of users in our survey. As the main source of information, we consider the $15$ participants in our experiments who were asked about their experiences with {\systemname}, their subjective sleep quality assessment, and details of their personal sleep patterns. This set of users was augmented with external participants who were asked about their interested in the events that {\systemname} is capable of detecting. The questions in our survey include:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Subjective sleep quality (5-levels, 1 for excellent and 5 for worst),
  \item Sleep duration,
  \item Sleep disturbances,
  \item Daytime dysfunction.
\end{enumerate}
For the above four items, each one is rated on a 1 to 5 scale. These scores are first summed to yield a total score, which ranges from 0 to 20. Then we merge every five neighboring scores into one scale and eventually divide the total scores into four levels, recorded as 0, 1, 2 and 3, representing poor, general, good and excellent, respectively. This step is necessary to compare the results of the user survey against the sleep quality estimation provided by {\systemname} and Fitbit.

In Table \ref{tab:quality}, we show the mean sleep quality score across 14 days given by each user together with the estimations produced by {\systemname} and Fitbit. We also give the standard deviation of the scores across the 14-day period per user. This number is given in the brackets next to the mean score. The last two rows in Table~\ref{tab:quality} compare the estimation given by {\systemname} and Fitbit against the user self-rating score. In these two specific rows, a label of `P' indicates an estimated score perfectly matches the user score, a label of `O' means the estimation error is within one scale point (for example, {\systemname} rates the user sleep to be excellent while the user's self-rating is good), and a label of `B' indicates the estimation error is greater than a scale point. As can be seen from the table, the estimation given by {\systemname} is more likely to match the user's self-rating compared to Fitbit (as indicated by having more `P' labels - 9 vs 6 ) and, unlike Fitbit, the estimation error given by {\systemname} is never greater than one scale point. To further validate this, we calculated the Spearman $\rho$-correlation~\cite{richardson2015nonparametric} between the user scores and each of the two systems, {\systemname} and Fitbit. {\systemname} provides higher correlation coefficient ($\rho = 0.842$) than Fitbit ($\rho = 0.500$). The difference in correlation was found statistically significant using a one-tailed test carried out through a Fisher r-z transformation ($Z = 1.66, p < 0.05$).  In summary, {\systemname} thus gives a better sleep quality assessment compared to Fitbit in our evaluation.

While the results above demonstrate that {\systemname} is capable of accurately estimating sleep quality, the main benefit from {\systemname} compared to previous works is not its sleep quality performance but its capability to analyze and capture the {\em root cause} of sleep issues. To demonstrate this, we carried out a follow-up analysis where we examined the events captured by {\systemname} for each of the six users assessing their sleep quality negatively (poor or general subjective quality, i.e., rating 0 or 1 in Table~\ref{tab:quality}). For four of the six users, we were able to find clear causes for their poor sleep. For one of the users, {\systemname} indicated difficulties in falling asleep, which was reflected in a high body rollover count. Further analysis of captured events indicated ambient noise and lighting to be most likely reasons for this participant. Another user complained of feeling of numbness in the arm after sleep. Events captured by {\systemname} showed that this was likely due to bad hand posture as the person tended to put the hand on top of the head before sleeping. The third user complained of frequent nightmares. Analysis of {\systemname} events showed that the person habitually slept on the left side, which has been shown to have the higher risk on nightmares~\cite{nightmare}, and often placed a hand on top of the chest, which creates additional pressure and can lead to nightmares. Finally, one of the users mentioned suffering from long-term snoring problems, which we also were able to detect from the events captured by {\systemname}. The events also highlighted that the person was often sleeping in the supine position, which further increases susceptibility to snoring-related problems. Existing systems are only capable of capturing some of these factors influencing sleep quality and thus they are not capable of providing a holistic view of the participant's sleep quality, whereas {\systemname} is capable of providing very detailed information about sleep events. To further demonstrate the benefits of {\systemname} compared to previous works, we asked the 15 participants to make appropriate adjustments according to our recommendations and to conduct a return visit survey three weeks later. It was found that some of the users were able to reduce symptoms and to improve their average quality of sleep based on the suggestions.
	
As for the user experience, results from the survey highlighted a strong interest in the information captured by {\systemname}. In particular, 80\% of participants believe that the detection of sleep posture is very necessary, showing their sleep posture can not only help people to avoid health problems caused by long-term improper sleeping posture, but also help us find out the reasons for the next day's physical discomfort, such as dizziness, muscle soreness may be due to improper sleeping posture. And there are some users are troubled by snoring. This may be due to improper sleeping posture. We map the detected snoring event and sleeping posture to suggest the user to modify his posture to a suitable posture to reduce the harm caused by long-term snoring. 60\% of the participants thought it useful to detect the hand position in supine posture, even one user mentioned that he did often have nightmares and our system found his hand was often placed on his chest, and then {\systemname} could remind him that he should take some measures to avoid such a position and thus reduce the poor sleep quality that nightmare brings. Only 20\% of participants found it useful to calculate the number of body rollover. However, detection of rollovers is useful in segmenting sleep stages. Furthermore, body rollover counts could be used to derive additional information to the user, such as how restless or peaceful the sleep has been overall.
