\section{CONCLUSIONS}
In this paper, we have presented {\systemname}, the first holistic smartwatch-based sleep monitoring solution that can simultaneously
estimate sleep quality and provide rich information about sleep events, including body motions, acoustic events related to sleep disorders,
and ambient illumination. To capture this information accurately, we have proposed new algorithms for extracting the relevant events from
sensor information. We demonstrated the benefits of {\systemname} through rigorous benchmark experiments carried out using measurements
collected from a two-week trial with $15$ participants. The results of our experiments demonstrate that {\systemname} provides comparable
sleep quality estimation accuracy compared to state-of-the-art consumer-grade sleep monitors, while at the same time being able to
accurately capture a richer set of information about factors influencing sleep quality. This information is particularly important for
identifying possible causes of poor quality sleep and can be used to provide the user with suggestions on how to improve their sleep
quality, e.g., by improving their sleep environment or behaviors surrounding sleep. We also compared the sleep quality estimates of
{\systemname} against subjective self-assessments, demonstrating a high degree of correspondence.
