\section{CONCLUSIONS}
In this paper, we have presented {\systemname}, the first holistic smartwatch-based sleep monitoring solution that can simultaneously estimate sleep quality and provide rich information about sleep events, including body motions, acoustic events related to sleep disorders, and ambient illumination. To capture this information accurately, we have proposed new algorithms for extracting the relevant events from sensor information. We demonstrated the benefits of {\systemname} through rigorous benchmark experiments carried out using measurements collected from a two week trial with $15$ participants. The results of our experiments demonstrate that {\systemname} provides comparable sleep quality estimation accuracy than state-of-the-art consumer grade sleep monitors, while at the same time being able to accurately capture a rich set of information about factors influencing sleep quality. This information is particularly important for identifying possible causes of poor quality sleep and can be used to provide the user with suggestions on how to improve their sleep quality, e.g., by improving their sleep environment or behaviors surrounding sleep. We also compared the sleep quality estimates of {\systemname} against subjective self-assessments, demonstrating a high degree of correspondence.
